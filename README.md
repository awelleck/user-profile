# user-profile

Building a user profile system with authentication. Using this as a place for notes as I go along, hopefully most makes it in the final README or automation script.

Using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) for installation
*`brew update`
*`brew doctor`
*`brew install python3`
*`brew install postgresql`

Setting up virtualenv to use Python 3
*`virtualenv ENV`
*`source ENV/bin/activate`
*`virtualenv -p python3 env`
